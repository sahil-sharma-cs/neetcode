# Blind 75 (neetcode) – Problems & their solutions

Blind 75 – This is my preparation journey of DS interviews as of 23/Aug/2025.

Here I’m sharing my daily problem-solving journey, including code and comments basis how I understand the problem.

## What’s Inside

This project is organized by study days, and covers the full spectrum of the LeetCode 75 plan:

- Arrays \& Strings
- Two pointers
- Linked Lists
- Stack, Queue
- Binary Trees, BST
- Sliding Window, Kadane’s
- Hashing, Prefix/Suffix
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

All code is written in **Java**. Each file includes comments about my approach, edge cases, and test examples.

***

## 🏹 How I Solve

- Review the problem statement on LeetCode
- Analyze constraints and optimal approaches
- Check embedded comments for sample inputs, tricky edge cases, and personal notes.
- Most solutions run directly in a Java IDE or using standard javac/java commands.

***

## 🚩 How to Use

1. Browse solution folders by day/topic
2. Open `.java` file for code and explanation
3. Run locally using Java 8+ (`javac FileName.java` \& `java FileName`)
4. Reference LeetCode for detailed problem statements
