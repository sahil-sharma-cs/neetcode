NeetCode 75 â€“ This is my preparation journey of DS interviews as of 23/Aug/2025.

Here Iâ€™m sharing my daily problem-solving journey, including code and comments basis how I understand the problem.

Whatâ€™s Inside
This project is organized by study days, and covers the full spectrum of the blind 75 plan:

Arrays & Strings
Two pointers
Linked Lists
Stack, Queue
Binary Trees, BST
