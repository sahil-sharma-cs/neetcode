NeetCode 75 – This is my preparation journey of DS interviews as of 23/Aug/2025.

Here I’m sharing my daily problem-solving journey, including code and comments basis how I understand the problem.

What’s Inside
This project is organized by study days, and covers the full spectrum of the blind 75 plan:

Arrays & Strings
Two pointers
Linked Lists
Stack, Queue
Binary Trees, BST
Sliding Window, Kadane’s
Hashing, Prefix/Suffix
Graphs
Dynamic Programming

All code is written in Java. Each file includes comments about my approach.


Organized by study day or topic
Solutions written in Java
Each problem folder includes:
Source code (.java files)
Problem statement as code comments
🏹 How I Solve
Review the problem statement on LeetCode
Analyze constraints and optimal approaches
Check embedded comments for sample inputs, tricky edge cases, and personal notes.
Most solutions run directly in a Java IDE or using standard javac/java commands.
🚩 How to Use
Browse solution folders by day/topic
Open .java file for code and explanation
Run locally using Java 8+ (javac FileName.java & java FileName)
Reference LeetCode for detailed problem statements
